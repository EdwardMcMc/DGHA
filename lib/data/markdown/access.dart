In line with Victorian State Laws, a person with low vision accompanied by a Guide Dog is permitted to:

- Travel on any form of public transport, including taxis, buses, trams and trains
- Enter any public place
- Visit any theatre
- Eat in any restaurant
- Shop in any store (including supermarkets and food stores)

The only exceptions where a Guide Dog is not permitted are operating theatres, commercial kitchens and some parts of the zoo.

It is generally discriminatory and unlawful for anyone to attempt to deny these rights to a person with low vision, or treat that person less favourably, solely because he or she is accompanied by a Guide Dog.

These laws also apply to people training Guide Dogs and Guide Dog puppies.
